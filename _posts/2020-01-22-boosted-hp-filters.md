We have built an accompanying repository for Peter Phillips and Shi (2019): "Boosting the Hodrick-Prescott Filter".

We offer two R script files:

1. **BoostedHP.R** contains the R function to implement the automated boosted HP filter. The inputs and outputs are detailed in the beginning of the function.
2. **testing_example.R** is a script to demonstrate the usage of the filtering procedure.

We welcome comments about the paper and the code.

Yang Chen is developing the code here into an R package BoostedHP. Though it is at a very preliminary stage, it can be installed and implemented in R.
